    <p>SAMPSON  Gregory, on my word we will not carry coals.</p>
    <p>GREGORY  No, for then we should be colliers.  </p>
    <P>SAMPSON  I mean, an we be in choler, we will draw</P>
    <p>GREGORY  Ay, while you live, draw your neck out of
        collar.
        </p>
    <p>SAMPSON  I strike quickly, being moved.</p>
    <p>GREGORY  But thou art not quickly moved to strike.</p>
    <p>SAMPSON  A dog of the house of Montague moves me.</p>

    <p>SAMPSON  A dog of that house shall move me to stand. I
        will take the wall of any man or maid of Montagues.</p>

    <p>SAMPSON  Tis true, and therefore women, being the
        weaker vessels, are ever thrust to the wall. Therefore
        I will push Montagues  men from the wall and
        thrust his maids to the wall.</p>

    <p>SAMPSON  Tis all one. I will show myself a tyrant.
When I have fought with the men, I will be civil
with the maids; I will cut off their heads.</p>

    <p>GREGORY  The heads of the maids?</p>
